that's it i'm entering maximum speed focus mode what's up guys dai gaming here and today we will be playing my favorite game ever tetra dot io yes this is unlike normal tetris because we've got multiplayer mode we've got solo mode and we've got config all right no no no all right we got solo mode um first i'm gonna do a quick 40 line warm-up we've already got the random battle music on we're gonna warm up because today we will be playing the tetra league that's right it's basically the pokemon league actually i don't know that at all that's just me making something up but yeah i know um i've been really hyped but i just haven't had the chance to play um the tetra league yet so i'm super excited today to be able to play that with you guys um but yeah so i've uh i've been putting this off because i actually suck at talking while playing this game so i've been trying to practice speaking while playing and not making any mistakes but it's not really working um yeah so anyway um uh focus on this focus yes there's lots of focus going on sometimes you know you just can't think of anything to say while playing tetris you know sometimes you just have to let the game speak for itself and uh yeah well those are the wise words of dai it sounds profound in my head but then i say it and it sounds so dumb oh god okay yes this is fine this is fine um right so uh i yes this goes here and this goes here and then we can just put this here boom boom but a bing but a boom yes we're looking good now we're looking really good okay all right we're almost done we're almost there done nice okay so 122 that's not a that's not a great time but for me chatting while playing that's a great time all right 122. all right now we're ready for the actual tetra league that's right we did a quick warm-up there the tetra league is a competitive 1v1 mode when duels against players of similar skill to rank up and conquer the leaderboards if you're new to stackers or feeling rusty it's a good idea to practice in other modes first well i might be feeling rusty but we're gonna find our first ever match that's right see 0 out of 10 rating games played so i will see you guys when we finally get a match because it seems like there's only 10 people in queue so i don't know if any of them will be my skill level all right guys i'm gonna go get some water i i doubt there's going to be a oh wow uh all right let's get going guys oh god it's us versus super lopo he's he's a b-plus tier i don't know what we're gonna i don't know if we're gonna be able to take him down okay all right here we go oh yes the applause the applause very well okay so there's no way he'll be able to stop us okay come on we can we can destroy him come on we got this guys don't let him stop us come on guys we got this nice nice we've already sent him lines oh no i've made a mistake i've made a grave error oh god guys okay it's okay it's okay it's okay focus focus we can do this we can do this oh god my my my nerves

like um um what's that one cinderella and and the seven dwarves oh no i'm building really high i'm laughing okay okay hold on guys hold on we gotta focus to make sure that we stay alive here because we can't lose to this person we cannot lose guys we can't lose here we can't let them have this we can't let them have this victory on us oh god the screen's turning red ah i can barely see no i can't lose no oh okay okay hold on hold on we can do this guys we can still do this we can still do this i know it looks grim i know it looks grim i know it looks bad but we've been out of tougher situations i've fought the kings of this game there's no way you can beat me oh no uh wait hold on we can do this we can still do this it's still it's no oh god super lopo beat us the first time it's okay it's okay we had a lot of missed plays that time i still think we can do it okay ready activate secret technique oh no oh no the secret technique is not gonna work this time it's okay spin the technique okay okay all right so we got the spin in um we still need to really focus here to make sure that we don't lose just right off the bat all right slide those in okay great we can't let this guy beat us so easily ah no i keep i keep throwing this place oh god oh lord oh lordy lou come on we gotta we gotta gotta believe guys we gotta believe that's the problem we're not believing hard enough right now but all we need is a little bit of energy here we go nice okay okay we can turn it around we can turn it around we can definitely turn it yes yes yes all right nice he's on the ropes now so all we have to do is not make any misplays here i feel like i just cursed myself but we don't need to make any misplaced here and then we might be able to push him over the top by making him lose through tetris um oh god um um okay we can do this check this out oh wait wait wait no i had it i had it no no no no it was so close i had it i felt it i could feel it slide in and but it didn't it didn't do it it didn't do it it like oh oh i threw it i threw it what do i do what do i do what do i do let's just panic let's just panic let's just send it as many lines as possible it's fine it's fine it's fine it's fine it's fine it's fine it's fine it's just uh uh you know honestly guys oh god i i'm panicking i'm i'm just there's just a lot of there's a lot of there's just okay it's okay it's okay oh oh oh snap okay oh god we're just letting him have us we can't let him take have his way with us also i'm glad this is like a best of three system or else it would be over already and we would have already wait okay hold on okay guys okay guys we can't just lose it here our story can't end here we need to win we need to be able to oh no no he's cleared lines how is this possible we must stop him with a t spin yes maximum potential t spin there there's no way there's no way you can beat me when i have all my potential lying outside the window with another t spin yes get wrecked by my t spin the setup oh god oh god okay wait hold on the t-spin setup won't work oh god oh god oh god no no we can't lie we can't dai here we're blinking we're blinking guys we're blinking no no no no he's got us it's two to zero oh god oh it's not best of three okay we can do this then all right we can't let him beat us again come on i know i know that he's good but it doesn't mean he's great and that means that we can beat him if we just put our minds to it if we just if we just completely try our best here he can't stop us he's feeling cocky he's feeling confident but now is the time we strike back after all we are dai gaming and we can't be oh oh lord what was that okay okay we can't let him just we can't let him just easy peasy us like this that is that is that is that is the term that is the tetris term for him destroying us here we can't let him easy peasy us so we have to bring it back okay okay we see that the tea is coming up so we we want to give him a little bit of sauce here so we're gonna rotate that in and so now he's gonna be a little bit more worried and then we can just try and play our best okay all right um okay i know the board is not looking good right now but i know the board doesn't look great but the board is ours and ours only so even if the board doesn't look great we know that at least it's our board and and our board is the best board okay okay we got this we got this we can bring it back we can bring it back okay okay don't worry guys okay this is fine um so we're gonna rotate these pieces like this we can't let him recover he's already recovering and that's the problem that's the greatest problem that's our problem right now we're just letting this guy have his way with us because we're letting him recover too easily oh no oh no we need time to recover as well though um hold on hold on we can do this we can do this okay that's it i'm entering maximum speed focus mode ah you can't stop me with that i'm in my maximum speed focus mode ah there's no way you can stop me i'm the protagonist of the story and this is the comeback of the century come on we can do it we just need a little more energy you're the villain and i have to stop you here or else the story can't go further okay no we made a mistake we've made an error in our judgment but that's okay because we've trained we've been fighting with the with the legends we've been fighting with the legends themselves so there's no way you can beat us because we've been fighting at this top speed since we've started ha nice t spin there to recover oh no he's attacking that's okay we can do this guys my hands are getting tired i've never been in a duel this intense oh no oh no a miss play is that our fatal error or we'll be able to or will we be able to turn it around here oh no okay all right we got this no don't cover that oh shoot no we need it no no no no no no we're throwing no no how can this be no no there's no way no no we threw at the last second we had it ah a defeat how did this happen look at the apm his apm was higher but our pieces per second were better let's tell them good game game super it was close guys it was really close oh are we gonna be fighting super lopro again no someone else brunito all right he's only a beat here we can do this guys we can beat a beat here come on b tiers are for getting beaten we can do this here's the league okay come on we're still reeling for my last fight but we're hungry we're hungry for a win and that's what this game's all about winning we can do it listen we've trained against super lopo himself isn't that right who am i talking to i don't know but isn't that right ah you think you can send me lines oh shoot you really can you're actually better than i you're better i mean sorry you're better than i thought [Music] well looks like i'm on the ropes now that's not a good thing that's actually not a good thing no okay we had to do that we had to do that because we were on the ropes and we needed to we needed to do that so that we had to block it we just had to um there was no other way i looked at all the chances that we had and that was the only way oh no how are we losing here we can't just lose here he's not a b plus he's an s tier [Music] no bonito okay all right we're gonna have to use our secret technique secret technique maximum potential perfect we don't have it we didn't get the lineup okay it's fine oh no oh no how's he going so fast he's ascended this guy this guy is in our normal our normal tetris player huh we're gonna have to spin it back to him he's not a normal tetris player he's more than that he's a tetris demon no not a tetris demon oh no okay we can't let him we can't let him just win it here we need to open the line the line has been opened and now we're sending it back come on we can get this win all we need to do is focus just focus a little bit just a tiny bit we can do it [Music] ah no we need to send it back immediately okay come on yes that's our first win guys okay we're tying it up [Music] we can do it we can do it all right activate secret technique perfect clear setup okay send this in no yes perfect clear oh lucria yes that sent him a ton of lines to start with now we have a little bit of time to work with even though we messed up the rest of our setups oh god oh lord okay all right hold on hold on hold on oh no oh no he's sending it all back now oh no oh no we were supposed to kill him there oh no oh no okay it's fine guys we can still turn it around okay it's okay just focus just focus hold on hold on we have to show him who's boss no he's opening the lines back this is bad this is really really bad no ah we didn't kill him fast enough with the perfect clear now he gets another point okay we're gonna try to risk it again a perfect clear setup we need to be able to do this fast enough so that he doesn't attack us okay um okay use your brain no it didn't work okay we're just gonna have to build we're gonna have to build quickly and without any regrets or that's not the word without any hesitation that's the word hesitation is the word i was looking for okay no no i made a mistake it's okay okay we're gonna have to hit him what we're gonna do is we're gonna hit him with two moves at once this is going to make it so that he can't even breathe oh god oh god i can't breathe oh no he set it up he set up the t spin strategy no no no it's a defeat no way we were so close look at his pieces per second they were so much lower than ours i can't believe this happened we knew what he was doing yeah we lost okay guys we've we've already taken two losses but that's not going to stop us uno mas here's the final the final game that i'll play and with this one we're gonna win so i'll see you guys when it happens maybe i just have to say that i want to get my water again and then they'll be like all right we got you a match ready watch watch watch guys i'm gonna go get some water a match

i'm not a b-minus i swear oh god i'm a b-minus i'm i'm oh my i'm the greatest did you see that a true a-tier player is able to come back from any oh god any uh oh no oh god oh jesus this is an ugly just hold on up i was originally trying to set up for a t-spin but oh lord okay um um hey hey hey stop sending lines really quick so that i can send them back okay no no no focus come on we can beat this guy easy he's only a b minus here and if i know something about us we're not b minus we're a no well you know we're not actually a uh okay come on let's just oh no oh oh god i'm i'm really doing poorly right now the last few games have made me weak i should have taken a break this back-to-back tetris thing has has made me lose my touch i spent myself on that first game trying to win and i couldn't clutch it so now this game i'm weaker than i usually am but my weak self is enough to take you down let's go nice one win for the for dai gaming okay we're gonna hit him with what he least expects a perfect clear off the bat perfect clear oh luckily nice oh god he sent us lines okay focus and we'll send them all back to him there's no way he'll be able to stop this this is what i call on the slot technique maximum potential [Music] because it's maximum potential because we end up with a spin goodbye that's two for us it's looking good here's the match point let's show him shrew terror full speed mode here we go be swift all right we're gonna focus this time and make sure that we play absolutely perfectly to give him a challenge that he deserves [Music] okay it's looking good he said so many lines at once was he not the noob that i thought he was no i i made a grave error it's okay we're gonna have to bring it back through a series of oh god through a series of clutch plays i know it might not look good for me right now but with the power of friendship anything is possible like turning it around yes it worked let's go oh good game oh we left the room yes yes i

the setup we're gonna go for a four wide this is crazy all right we're gonna go for a four wide no one has ever seen dai gaming do this before um we already screwed it we already screwed up i uh this is why dai gaming never does oh god oh god okay hold on no no wait hold on hold on hey hey we can talk about this i'm just trying to get like a four wide setup going you know so uh if you could just

this is mine i mean this is this is fine this is still money um we we sent him a lot of lines probably i mean if i was really good at the game i'd peek over at a screen right now but then i'd have to stop playing should i do it oh yeah he's like almost dead go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go he's he's almost dead he's almost dead it's almost it's pretty much okay it's pretty much

that's of course yeah okay great um i think he's dead see ya that's a win i don't need a move yes nice match point guys match point we're doing really well today we're just completely creaming them what is this okay um we're gonna try again with a perfect clear here and the secret technique of the perfect clear is that you just have to use your brain because then you get a perfect clear and then everyone's like oh shoot he got a perfect clear like he used his brain and then watch this watch just watch this uh no i don't think i could have gotten an another one though oh man gg pal oh well i'll type gg to you even though you're gone yeah that was pretty good guys man starting off strong this time i mean hey i'll take it oh another one is it against pal pal3 no what does this mean seven

got destroyed so this time we're gonna try we're gonna try and get this against um joe han here okay this is this is no joke this is a b plus we lost to the b pluses last time so this time we're just gonna have to give them our main technique of perfect clearing them at the very start and then we're just gonna let them do their thing okay oh no oh no oh no ah i messed it up i messed it i'm pretty sure it probably could have been possible there it looked possible it felt possible dang it um this is okay we can't screw around with with these guys uh we gotta really really give it to him we got to make sure that these guys are more on the ropes than we are at all times um oh geez all right counter that immediately oh god i'm building so weird i can't go fast like this ah i didn't mean that

the set up into the sauce that's what they say in france sorry man it's i didn't make the rules i didn't make the rules i didn't make the rules but the rules say that you can't attack me now it's part of the rules it's part of the rules part of the rules i didn't make him i didn't make him to do you complain to the complaint to complain to the people oh god uh the rules the rules uh the rules say

second all right we're gonna go again but i think this next one is my last game and i'm gonna try and get a 3-0 here if i can that would be crazy we'd have literally a perfect day no losses there's only six in queue though so i think this one might take oh never mind i guess it's i guess all six of them were just chilling at my level we're against an a tier okay i i need my parents to be proud of me so i have to get i have to beat khalido here to know that i am a tier okay all right i will not disappoint you father okay here we go here we go here we go um we're gonna start with a uh perfect clear setup um because okay we can't mess around um we really have to just pop off here oh baby okay and then we can't mess around so we're gonna go for a just a a complete attack here um because we don't want him to get the upper hand oh god he's already he's already like sending things back ah okay come on come on we can do this we can do this one oh oh god two yeah come on three four he's so

perfect day but if you liked what you saw and you want to see more don't forget to perfect clear that like button soft drop a comment down below but most importantly tetris that subscribe button if you haven't already it lets me know that you're enjoying this tetris grind as much as i am um but other than that i guess i'll see you guys in the next video peace um okay okay dai focus dai focus time focus absolute no no what's up guys dai gaming here and today we will be playing some more tetra.io as you know i'm gonna do a quick warm-up uh now we've got stride mode active wait did i have stride mode activated last game i honestly don't remember um because i've just been playing this game so much we are just going to warm up real quick and then we'll be able to uh to play out some ranked uh let me get all this here okay flip that ah yes nice nice um but yeah uh you know i i think today we'll be able to play a couple games in our new rank so that'll be super cool and uh you can watch me de-rank immediately and yeah i mean other than that i'll see you guys in the next video oh wait wait wait wait no no no um yeah it's just a little more oh 110 that's a good time thank you that's a good warm up guys okay all right nice not not one of my top 10 scores i mean not to flex or anything but all my top 10 scores i'm pretty sure are sub whatever it is okay eight out of ten seven in the queue it is time let's queue in and see what happens yo match down all right we're up against an a minus tier 11 000 tr okay we can do this we can beat this a minus i'm pretty sure we got this all right we're gonna tell him good luck good luck all right it's looking like a all right we're gonna try a new new strategy a risky play but will really pay off if we get it really quick all right um uh so i panicked i panicked and cleared a line there i don't think i needed to um okay one two three f no no no way no way i threw that there's no way there's no i swear oh no we're not starting off good okay we're gonna all right we're we're already on the on the down trend and we haven't even started yet okay um yes bring it back no i'm okay i'm throwing i'm throwing guys i'm really seriously i just you know usually we joke about this and we say i'm throwing when we're not actually throwing but but i'm seriously throwing oh god okay um um i'm i'm panicking uh it's okay it's okay oh it's money oh it's cash it's cash oh it's cash it's it's cash holy okay all right all right all right okay come on come on we can clutch out we can catch up oh wait let's wait i didn't dangle the piece so it wasn't even i just moved it in all right i'll see you i'll see you buddy you you there's no way you can live this because i'm gonna spin you out of existence boom satisfying oh shins oh shins oceans rise and empires fall if you get that reference you're a cool person um oh no i double tapped i double tapped because i was all these cool people oh god okay wait wait no no we okay oh okay guys guys guys give me give me one second you know it's it's the first game i wasn't expecting this guy to be that quick you know it's um you know you can't you can't really fault me here right it's it's this guy it's wait okay wait hold on focus focus hold on hold on hold on there's only two things that really matter in this game and it's me getting my t spins and me getting my good rank um all right sorry that t-spin is not gonna happen squad uh but oh god okay hold on um but hopefully we can clear that out okay now that that's open we're oh my god we're like a christmas tree without the christmas let's go i don't know what that means but here's a teaspoon to make it all make sense okay yeah that's good that's some good stuff there [Music] um okay this game is lasting really a little too awkwardly long man i don't have this much commentary brother so if you could just perish here that would be really wonderful um okay yeah put this here put this here put this here put this here clear that open now we put this here and we put that there and we kind of panicked but then we put that there and that's like really good and then we put this here and then we go here and then bada bing bada boom suddenly we're on the uh we're on the we're on the not ropes and then you know and then this goes and then and then oh my and then this and then this smaa smaa sma nice well played thank you you too i yeah okay i don't have time to be talking to you because i need to win i don't know i don't know how i you know you're you know you you you're casually speaking but you know it's taking my effort here it's really i'm really struggling you know okay double clear there don't let him have any room to breathe um and then we can just be good oh my god it's a sauce oh my no no are you kidding me i'm just i'm just so how am i doing this how am i this bad today i you i'm just uh he was actually dead there i'm pretty sure because uh he was he was like really high i saw the oh oh god guys guys uh i don't want to talk about it nobody say anything all right nobody nobody say a thing about this i don't want to talk about let's not speak let's not speak about the horrors that you've witnessed today here in the oh here in the family oh god he's gonna beat me he's gonna beat me he's gonna beat me unless unless unless oh god okay wait okay guys hold on i'm entering dai focus dai focus my secondary persona that never throws oh script i'm throwing ah i mean shoot i met shoot ah they cursed me because i cursed dang it all right smaw all right sma all right well played all right smoke that was well played that was well played um so you might be noticing i'm not running my usual strategy of just trying to um run a uh a uh what's it called you know what i'm talking about guys that what's it called thing that what's it called you know oh shoot um god i i don't know what it's called oh perfect clear my brain was just exploding i was trying to think of the tetris and it just wasn't it wasn't working uh but yeah yeah yeah i haven't been running the the perfect clear as you guys have noticed it's because i dai here uh nine times out of nine okay all right sma um you're lucky that i was i was thinking about perfect clear okay we're gonna run it we're gonna run it i can't read your message buddy i'm not gonna do it [Music] i'm sorry i i can't i i need to i need to win this game i don't want to be an a minus i need to be something greater i need to be an eight here you know any other time i would have loved to chat but oh lord every other time you would have left the chat no no you're so what holy gg jesus he's so fast man small wow well played and he even said don't go gently into that dark ht i don't even know what this means but all right troop good game guys we're gonna queue again you know the first one's a loss but the next one's gonna be a win all right watch just just watch the next one will be a win it'll be a win and you guys will be like wow dai i'm so glad that i chose to support you in your endeavor it'll be great there's cheese pizza in the oven wait all right lmfao one two three two six all right yeah that'll be how many rounds i i win against you i i i'm just i i am a clever boy okay here we go here we go here we go t spin set up i mean not t you guys knew what it meant you guys knew what i meant oh no i didn't know what i meant oh oh jesus um i meant to say i just i just set up a little slowly that time good sir uh so if you could just uh chill for a little bit i would love that much appreciated buddy um you know there's there's a lot of stuff that could be done here oh lordy lou as they say in france this is a this is a classic mexican standoff except i'm i'm dead i'm so i'm okay um so uh don't you know that in oh here it is guys yes the only time it ever worked oh my god i'm the greatest player okay i'm not allowed to lose now i can't lose i can't lose i can't if i lose i'll be oh no wait two foot two two for two squad ah oh wait wait okay hold on i got too excited there okay um yes i can't believe that happened i cannot believe i actually cannot believe that happened that's crazy oh god okay uh we're just gonna have a t-spin so that we can keep playing um okay uh oh no um oh shoot wait wait wait you can't get rid of me that easily yeah okay come on no no no i placed it horizontally ten years oh he's wearing a t-spin setup he's running a t-spin set up okay all right we're gonna have to beat him with a four wide this strategy only works when i'm in the greatest situations it never works in any other all right uh it's not gonna work oh god why am i trying new things against like players that are actually like really good uh um i don't know i don't know oh god i'm panicking okay let's just put this in here call it a day you know it oh god okay wait hold on hold on man hold on man um uh this goes here and then and then and then this goes like this and then you don't hit me don't hit me don't please don't hit me we can be friends hey hey buddy uh i i i oh did i tell you that your shirt looks just really stellar today it looks beautiful um please don't hit me oh gosh you um you have such beautiful eyes um what's your name again oh god they're gonna punish me because i didn't know their name um oh oh no i threw a little bit but oh money oh no okay hold on hold on he's kind of on the ropes here so i feel like if i play my cards he won't be able to see play my cards wrong and because he can't see my incorrect heart there's no feasible way he wins because he doesn't know what i'm doing wrong and that's my logic here uh it is not flawed because i don't even know what i said and that's part of the chart that's the charm of things oh god the charm he cleared his saucy i should have been faster this whole time but now it's all the ropes are on and honestly i can't live dang it okay all right match point guys i know it's the last game but we can we can win this match point we can win this match point i've never seen us okay why did you do that at the very start of the game man okay um i was watching a tetris tutorial video all right so i know that there's a secret maneuver you can do here alright so when you're on the ropes like me and you need huge assistance it is the 100 rule to try and um build goodly and that is the secret you just have to build well and as you know i am the best builder since 1904 i used to be a builder um back in my back in my youth and oh my god it worked it worked okay all right yes okay nice nice okay all right great great great great great great that's that's that's that's beautiful that's like that's so pretty that is oh my gosh did you see how beautiful that was wow there's so much beauty in the eye of the beholder there geez there's like a t spin here oh god so pretty so now um if we all just pay attention to the powerpoint presentation here that's another t spin um and yeah so that's the that's part of the powerpoint uh here's another t-spin what the i'm just on it i'm literally on it right now what is this how am i setting up so many teeth i'm okay i'm gonna be honest guys all those were on accident and so i don't really know how it's happening you don't know how it's happening who knows how's it happened who who knows how's it how it how here's another teaspoon um and then there's a there's a cool spin and then here's a not cool spin but into a into a oh there's another t-spin set up okay well here you go buddy um and then we just kind of like let it uh let it do its thing and then we just kind of go for it and then the pieces just kind of fall into play and i'm just oh here's another t-spin oh my god who am i who am i right now i'm just i'm okay i mean i guess it's it's just all p-spins um you know sometimes you just activate t-spin mode and then it's just uh it just happens okay um pretty sure i can kill him here if i just kind of play my cards a little bit correctly okay okay if i just play my cards a little bit correctly proceeds to put the piece in china in literal china oh god oh yes oh yeah yes oh nice um okay that worked out well for me that's not working out as well uh um um okay uh so we're gonna do this uh can we hang a block oh god we can't hang up all right hold on um okay so it was going really well with the t-spin setups before and now it's going what they call really poorly and poorly is actually the opposite of well uh i don't know if you guys knew that but it's true and now it's going really well again and that's what really counts because this guy you know they don't know how bad i am and so they probably think i'm really good but in reality i'm just kind of winging everything and it's just working and i'm like okay that's cool and oh my god okay all right guys lmfao tiebreaker here we go here we go all right let's make it count um we're gonna start with one of these monies and you know this has never failed me except for all the times it's family yes it's gonna film me okay come on come on come on come on um come on we can do this we can do this we can do this hold on hold on i'm taking this i'm taking this really seriously now buddy i'm taking this really seriously because i have a chance at victory and it's gonna look so good in the video if i if i come back from this so no mercy um okay that's gonna go there um that's gonna go there and then i can be able to t spin here into this thing into into just the comeback the king are you serious let's go let's go that's a dub yes yes good game good game lmfo who am i where am i a minus is this a minus this is a minus is this a minus play more games to receive a rank oh my god all right well i all right guys we're gonna play some more games i thought i was gonna get my rank but uh and i guess it's not a rank reveal until we play more games is it because i only won six is that why all right well i'll see you when we get there i remember what i was gonna say it was oh we have a game all right well i guess you guys will never know oh my god why am i against an a plus tier he's literally 5k better than me do you see this do you see this matchmaking guy oh god oh no oh lord he's he's the salty warrior i've heard about this person in legends only i oh my oh my gosh oh my gosh this is crazy this is madness um okay fine fine wait what am i doing my brain broke my brain broke oh god um hold on okay all clear we gave him an all clear there he's probably hurt oh i spit oh yeah okay guys if you haven't already subscribe for that i spin are you serious uh that was crazy all right and if you know that's just that's just that's just the start of it you know the next thing you know i'll be doing i'll be doing q spins and there's not even a q block in this game oh god um speaking of q spins let me focus a little bit so we don't get q spinned out of existence [Music] um okay okay dai focus dai focus time focus absolute no no all right all right that was that was uh i don't want to talk about it um i think i can no i'm just going to try to beat him with speed you know i was watching this tetris tutorial and they say always um use your eye blocks for attack and i was thinking about it i was like okay that kind of makes sense though right because it's like you know if you waste it on if you waste it on not attack then you you just don't get as much bang for your buck and that's just like oh man no buck no bang right and you just okay yeah it was gonna be coherent until i started panicking and then it would and then it became even more coherent right guys you know exactly what i was going for oh shoot oh my oh oh mumble bumble oh oh elephants are green tea spin here oh beautiful uh this is a setup into another t-spin if i can make it to the next t p spin again it's money oh salty warrior it's a tie baby that's what i call a double t spin into the middle of the game there's no way you expect that there's no way you just can't you can't prepare for that that's like unpreparable ill-prepared um yeah but they were like save your save your guys for when you need to when you need to attack and i was like okay i'll i'll try to do that um but you know no promises and yeah so we're going to try to implement that kind of and maybe that'll work for us oh god i didn't mean to do it like this the stars have on a line it's not looking good for me but it's looking great for me all of a sudden how did this ch oh it's looking terrible it's looking terrible what the he is like an elephant without toes what the he's an elephant without toes how you expect me to beat an elephant without toast how do you expect me to do that there's no way there's no feasible way have you ever been an elephant without toast no so is it possible that i can be an elephant about those maybe but no i put the guy on top of the other guy oh man all right one two one to two we make it we make it dude we make it do we make it do the one to two okay um so this time okay wait guys i don't i don't want to lose so you're about to see me go hyper focused you ready here we go three two one hyper focus mold [Music] i i don't like the things that i stand for i said hyper focus mode and then proceeded to throw completely oh god um yeah oh ouch that that hurt a little bit um good game um yes uh yes um i'm just gonna let's just let's just queue again guys let's let's just yeah okay all right thank god okay it's it's right here okay good good oh no if you're here while you're unranked this means that you're a god oh no oh he foo me oh gosh this is oh no okay all right we can we can do something here it looks like a t-spin setup i'm gonna be honest i mean i got perfect clear setup i mean i could do a t-spin setup it's just not worth it to me because i'm really slow and and that's the problem i'm not i'm not a good t-spin set-up um i'm just gonna do this oh you did it so badly man ah who are you who am i who are who are i hm something seems wrong um so okay i was going for a two wide this whole time actually guys this is my new technique it's called the 2y um back in the 1940s this technique was used by many professional players to sort of flex on the other goons this technique was used mainly in uh this southern uh hemisphere as a technique to uh defeat the mongolians from uh attacking them by guy okay cool um that was a good game you know i i'm just gonna guess that goes there honestly uh i uh yeah cool it works um so speaking of the mongolians here oh gosh if i was if i was just a little bit smarter maybe i would have won that okay well um you're doing that thing it's called attacking and i don't really appreciate that so i'm gonna just like do this you know what i mean and then i'll do that you know i feel like i should t spin more i feel like t spinning just gives you like the t to t winning you know you just t spin and then like the other people are just like oh gosh how do we deal with it and then you're just like i don't know i'm not the one getting t spin on so you know good luck man and then they're just like oh god oh my god oh my god what oh my i just oh my god how many lines is that a million two million maybe three million it's probably three million honestly if i were to if i were to take a guess there that was probably three million that's that's probably three million and i mean okay guys if you wouldn't subscribe for three million three million lines have you ever seen that in tetris probably not and let me tell you i just did it so you know you know hit that hit that subscribe button if you haven't already you know it's it's it's it's part of the it's part of all right all right hold on i gotta say i gotta stop self-promoting or else i'm actually gonna lose okay how about this i'll make a bet with you guys if i win this and you're watching this video you subscribe if you haven't already and if i lose then you don't have to subscribe but if i win if i win out this the rest of this

water yep some good stuff just admiring myself oh god all right all right all right come on a minus here basket of chias all right all right basket of chias let's go first game of the day what kind of setup do we want to run looking at this easy four wide easy four wide you ready watch this risky play for a four wide but it's it's there i see the pieces and they have a line um so if we do it like this oh man oh man oh no um no oh god oh lord okay um easy forward they said uh easy easy game they said um more like oh shoot come on man um i i just ruined my board okay um here let's play let's play clean up let's play cleanup okay so um yeah this is fine and then we put this here put this here put this here all right now we're kind of we're back in it now we're back in it um and honestly you know man you shouldn't have gone up against me i'm literally the greatest and yeah i wish that t spin did anything but it really didn't and so what we need to do here is put stuff down immediately no cheers man all right all right warm-up game that was a warm-up game i tried something new a four-wide kind of weird but if we do our usual opener the perfect clear opening i feel like we'll be on st what what what do you mean why did you send me a line what nobody sends me along okay yes all right nice guys nice that's how we do it that's how we do it nobody's supposed to send me a line there you weren't supposed to completely ruin my opening that doesn't make sense how did you know this guy's been analyzing my moves he's reading me but that's okay um you know it's because of my fame he already knows and you know what sometimes you're just so famous that these people already know your moves but that's okay because they need the extra uh um uh whatever the extra advantage to clutch out against me and you know we'll let them have it because we don't need oh my god we don't need we don't need information on them because we got this in the oh no oh no oh no you're so oh oh god okay wait hold on no no no turn around here don't you dare don't you dare don't you dare oh my god let's go i bet you guys thought i was gonna dai there me too let's go all right nice nice it's the t spins man my practice from the mountains of uh oh my god the mountains of bagool baby that was some clean bean dream stuff man um but speaking of clean bean dream stuff hey buddy i'm gonna need you to chill for a second so that i can just destroy you with a t-spin set up oh let's go and then we hit you with another one oh it's all cash and money let's go basket of chias we're killing it we're killing it all right now let's finish him off with another perfect clear set oh no oh no i've done myself dirty wait i've developed a new strata oh god wait all right never mind i did not develop anything um how you doing man oh he's like building up okay that's cool uh okay it's a lot less cool now if you could just like okay buddy come on let's not be immature here and send lines while i'm down right hey hey okay all right fair is fair chias you know you may get a tie breaker all right this time we're not messing around speed for speed i'm gonna show you guys what it means to have the speed of dai gaming and this speed's incredible if you blink you'll miss it all right not not really but you know we can we can pretend like the line okay the line was cool right guys i mean as long as the line was i mean here i mean that was cool right i mean that was that was pretty cool if you guys i i mean honestly i mean oh god um so so uh yes it worked oh my god i didn't think i'd win there but hey nice unexpected victory i'll tell them i'll play well played nice that's a victory for me oh give me those rankings baby give me those rankings yes all right basket i'm out of here let's go again easy enter match making and you will be matched up with a player of a similar skill in a game of one versus who won the versus whoa well they were just waiting for me to finish reading the lines oh all right animals of b plus here um so i don't want to like be like oh like this guy's only b plus here let me try some stuff on him but i feel like this is the only chance i'm gonna get to try some stuff so we are going to try some stuff on them here we go i'm gonna try the four wide set up except to actually get it this time i call it scales uh so we'll do this and then okay we have a that coming up so we can do this and then we have a this and then we have this and all right here's the setup here we go one two three all right that's it that's our maximum capacity shoot one two three four five six seven eight and then uh eight was our top okay eight eight eight's our cap okay i mean that was pretty good we'll take it we'll take you know what we'll take it i mean we didn't um i mean we didn't like kill it but like we did pretty good and i mean i feel like as long as we did pretty good that's all that really oh no oh no oh no oh no oh god oh lord um okay all right b plus i i took i took him for granted i took him for granted all right um um here's this put this here put this here flip this and then we switch this around uh gonna put that there put that there to put that there open that up and then we can um we can move it here and then we can put that there flip it around do that do this push downwards with that move and then we can put this vertically here put this here clear that line because we need to clear that line or else we're screwed um then push that side push there then we can flip that around and this will let us down stack here pushing this down and then we can push that over there and then place this piece here then putting clearing couple more lines this allows us to open up enough to start setting up for a much bigger attack uh while we're doing this we notice that he is not doing that great he's pretty high up as are we but we have a nice clean line here as opposed to his um kind of messy line uh and then we have to throw a little bit because that's a classic that does that gaming maneuver uh and then miss play our easily slide in a bowl piece uh but that's okay because that always happens to us anyway uh after that we can put this over on this side then clearing out a couple more lines giving us a really nice clean board in comparison with him uh honestly i should just be become a tetris caster i feel like i got i got this tetris in the on the on the on the on the ropes no not the ropes on the in the i uh uh down pat yeah down pat sure boom baby a nice clean game near the end nice clean game a nice dai gaming clean game all right um here's my second new strategy it's called i was going to save this for later but i'll show you guys now it's called secreto technique [Music] boom baby uh that's all uh was it worth it no probably not but was it cool i mean hey probably did you think it was cool i thought it was cool uh oh t-spin single baby that's what we call a nice sassafras maneuver yes the sassafras maneuver was actually used by the um the the southern members of the oh god jesus calm down man geez i'm trying to explain my techniques and you're going to they're like attacking me with like all you got like come on let's just chill for a second oh um sorry animal um right uh i'm just gonna i'm uh yeah sorry my bad i'll just you know i'll just oh fun me oh fondue oh just just ah god okay um hey yes yes money they love to see it we love to see it you love to see it and they love to see it who doesn't love to see it that's right only the enemy and you know what if the enemy doesn't like to see it then we love to see it that's part of the rules oh god okay um um where's the where's the piece that i'm looking for all right nice that was really close but now we're just oh my god oh my god i'm so sorry holy oh my god holy smokes that was like a million lines oh god um damn all right um that's a good that's it oh we did it our tier a midas yes there it is the a minus all right we're in the a tiers guys this is great look at that look at that oh uh you know i'm uh one the one one 204 best player in the world you know me i mean no in the country you know me you know me casual casual flex not not to not to not the flex or anything but uh now you can see this uh one thousand two hundred and fourth place player play some one thousand and two hundred and what play some one thousand two hundred and fourth place games here we go oh sweet let's go wait we got switched our servers changed our servers changed did you see that in the bottom right our servers got changed this means that they have the server advantage danes all right good luck have have fun here we go we can't let him win here okay that's not where that piece was supposed to go but we can all pretend that's where it was right okay we're gonna hit him with a little bit of an early punch there uh not because i wanted to but more like because it just was it just happened to be like that uh but yeah so looking at this i'm not too worried just because you know am i being tier tier ranked ranked racist is that what i'm being right now is that do i need to like step things up for for people i i don't i don't really know am i i mean i mean it's kind of working you know i'm not losing these games but but you know maybe it's kind of rude you know to just like try things out on players that i think that i'll probably win again no i don't think it's rude right guys i mean i mean i could just do this and then this and then this and then like people think i'm like pretty good yeah good stuff good stuff this is uh oh oh jesus okay um okay now now you're getting a little cocky there dai oh she's uh dai i feel like you could have won this game if you had just like played like i feel like this wasn't a hard turn around for you there we go nice all right james that's pretty good and tnt all right you can tell like that i'm a little more relaxed just because uh you know i'm like talking to my opponent like i usually don't do that because oh my god because they would be sad at me perfect clearing them in the first two seconds of the game okay um and then we can send this right back to him and then we can uh push a little bit there uh we're gonna have to do it like that okay the problem whenever i send a perfect clear is that it's actually really seriously a a detriment sometimes um because then they get all these lines that they originally wouldn't have had and then i'm sitting here and they're like able to just combo the with jesus out of me because i'm just okay all right um because i'm like i'm uh i've given them the opportunity you know what i mean there's a chance the chance uh as they say okay cool and then see ya it's nice knowing you all right danes i'm gonna try a new move all right no one has ever seen this move yet because i will i'm never able to pull it off but we're going for it if you guys recognize what this move is you guys are pro tetris players indeed um because i don't think i can pull it off or can i or can i wait wait for it squad all i need is straight all i need is straights no no we can do it no so close oh my god we almost got it with the full t-spin set up triples all the way up all right all right we can't mess around anymore he said thanks all right i see i see i see okay all right all right he's you know he's he's that's either a uh like thanks or that's like a sarcastic things in which he was like you know he was like now that i beat him i'll like laugh at him um so i'm gonna have to give it to him dai gaming style just in case he means it like that i gotta prove my worth you know i can't just like i can't just like silly dally here you know i gotta i gotta make sure he knows that i mean business you know i i gotta oh god did he get a perfect clear or something what the all right man all right i see i see i shouldn't have i should have taken you lightly alright i understand you want to play with the big boys and you know what i'll give you what you want i'll let you have it i'll let you become one of us [Music] this is the difference between an eight-year player and a b-tier player pure t spins no i i wish i could do that that would be so sick could you imagine like one of these like if in the future i could just be like pure t spins and then just like completely spin out on someone that'd be crazy but i i can't so but just to pretend that it happened right like pretend that you just like whoa dai you're crazy and then oh oops misplay it's all good though we cured it nice ggs ggs nice guys it's a stop today they put me in the wrong place they put me in the incorrect location guys nice whew let's keep going i feel like we can just keep climbing let's enter matchmaking again you know try and face someone off someone new three two one now oh it kind it was close guys it was close it was close there was no editing there it was close all right all right cogent he's an eightier all right all right all right all right now it's it's time for some real what the why did you appear all right it's time for some real stop stop oh all right he has that he's a okay he has a 40 line of 1 minute 13. theoretically we win this if it's all up to speed theoretically we win this if it's all up to speed all right we're gonna start perfect uh perfectly for sure all right it looks like they're like temporarily afk or something so this is kind of good for us are you okay cogent coaching hey cogent i i cogen [Music] good cogent good coaching i'm an honorable man oh hey hey i started waiting for you and then you started is it i feel like cogent's having some struggles i was kind of waiting for him a little bit there but you know maybe there's maybe it's all fair in love and war i don't really know cogen i'm really i'm okay okay coaching all right this is what i get for waiting for you i guess um i should have just i should have just attacked him when i had the chance i should have just attacked him when i had the chance he said here what were you thinking what were you thinking you had to play dirty there you were supposed to play 30 but but i'm an honorable man you know i wouldn't hit a man while he's down that's part of my my dogma you know i i couldn't i couldn't do something to him something so rude as he is doing unto me something so terrible i've been helpful okay cogent all right cogent i understand how it is we're playing dirty coaching i'm not waiting for you anymore cogent i'm not gonna wait for you cogen i'm not gonna do it i'm not gonna wait for you coaching i'm not gonna do it i'm not gonna let you have this because i get it first i get it first i'm not waiting for you coaching didn't i tell you uh double all clear eh that's pretty sick that's actually really sick cool cool play coaching that was a cool play that was mighty fine of you all right i waited for i did wait for him i i did wait for it at the start so now you know now i feel like anything's fair game you know i waited for him he waited for me it's all it's all fun and games and love and games and war and games and love and war and games and war love okay all right you're really not making sense anymore dai you know sometimes you just gotta joy as a gift and this is the box it comes in and that's a mcdonald's commercial don't don't sue me okay um this goes here then this can go here which allows this to go here and then now we're on the ropes somehow because there's been a misunderstanding hey buddy it's me dai gaming here with some dai gaming action all right cogent okay it's match point guys guys it's really match point we really have to do something here what we're gonna do is good luck have fun this late in the game he said good luck have fun all right all right if that isn't if that isn't nice niceties i don't know what is he took the time out of his day to say good game have fun and that means that we're gonna have to attack them with everything we got oh no oh god oh lord oh oh geez okay um good luck have fun to you man oh why why isn't it working oh check mate on ourselves man check mate on ourselves don't you hate it when we oh no no way no way yo no don't kill me here don't kill me here if you were a nice man you want to kill me here you want to do it you want to do it you want to do it you wouldn't do it because you were nice you want to do it i waited for you i i did wait for you hey i waited for you i waited for you remember that you remember that i remember that i remember that like it was yesterday i waited for you like it was yesterday except it was today and i waited for you today like it was yesterday you know so i think it's only fair that you wait for me to t spin the vegisms out of you let's go cogen let's go guys all right all right all right guys it is a deal we're gonna take him down oh god he's not messing around i hear the the speed in which he's placing his blocks it's kind of scaring me just a little bit i'm gonna be honest um you know i i am not exactly used to playing against good players as of right now oh jesus ah don't let him have this you can't let him have just an easy easy clutch out here oh god i misread i misread the piece oh no that's actually really bad that's really really bad i misread the piece oh no it might be checkmate guys but we're gonna try our best oh dang it that piece misread a cogent gg's cogent [Music] all right i mean fair's fair not quite an atu yet i guess um i feel like some games i'm on some games i'm off the question is do we play one more do we go do we go one more time do we roll the dai one
