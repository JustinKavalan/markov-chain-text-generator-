mode active wait did i have stride mode activated last game i honestly don't remember because i've just been playing this game so much we are just going to warm up real quick and then we'll be able to uh to play out some ranked uh let me get all this here okay flip that ah yes nice nice but yeah uh you know i i think today we'll be able to play a couple games in our new rank so that'll be super cool and uh you can watch me de-rank immediately and yeah i mean other than that i'll see you guys in the next video wait wait wait wait no no no yeah it's just a little more 110 that's a good time thank you that's a good warm up guys okay all right nice not not one of my top 10 scores i mean not to flex or anything but all my top 10 scores i'm pretty sure are sub whatever it is okay eight out of ten seven in the queue it is time let's queue in and see what happens yo match down all right we're up against an a minus tier 11 000 tr okay we can do this we can beat this a minus i'm pretty sure we got this all right we're gonna tell him good luck good luck all right it's looking like a all right we're gonna try a new new strategy a risky play but will really pay off if we get it really quick all right uh so i panicked i panicked and cleared a line there i don't think i needed to okay one two three f no no no way no way i threw that there's no way there's no i swear no we're not starting off good okay we're gonna all right we're we're already on the on the down trend and we haven't even started yet okay yes bring it back no i'm okay i'm throwing i'm throwing guys i'm really seriously

squad uh but god okay hold on but hopefully we can clear that out okay now that that's open we're my god we're like a christmas tree without the christmas let's go i don't know what that means but here's a teaspoon to make it all make sense okay yeah that's good that's some good stuff there [Music] okay this game is lasting really a little too awkwardly long man i don't have this much commentary brother so if you could just perish here that would be really wonderful okay yeah put this here put this here put this here put this here clear that open now we put this here and we put that there and we kind of panicked but then we put that there and that's like really good and then we put this here and then we go here and then bada bing bada boom suddenly we're on the uh we're on

shoot i met shoot ah they cursed me because i cursed dang it all right smaw all right sma all right well played all right smoke that was well played that was well played so you might be noticing i'm not running my usual strategy of just trying to run a uh a uh what's it called you know what i'm talking about guys that what's it called thing that what's it called you know shoot god i i don't know what it's called perfect clear my brain was just exploding i was trying to think of the tetris and it just wasn't it wasn't working uh but yeah yeah yeah i haven't been running the the perfect clear as you guys have noticed it's because i dai here uh nine times out of nine okay all right sma you're lucky that i was i was thinking about perfect clear okay we're gonna run it we're gonna run it i can't read your message buddy i'm not gonna do it [Music] i'm sorry i i can't i i need to i need to win this game i don't want to be an a minus i need to be something greater i need to be an eight here you know any other time i would have loved to chat but lord every other time you would have left the chat no no you're so what holy gg jesus he's so fast man small wow well played and he even said don't go gently into that dark ht i don't even know what this means but all right troop good game guys we're gonna queue again you know the first one's a loss but the next one's gonna be a win all right watch just just watch the next one will be a win it'll be a win and you guys will be like wow dai i'm so glad that i chose to support you in your endeavor it'll be great there's cheese pizza in the oven wait all right lmfao one two three two six all right yeah that'll be how many rounds i i win against you i i i'm just i i am a clever boy okay here we go here we go here we go t spin set up i mean not t you guys knew what it meant you guys knew what i meant no i didn't know what i meant jesus i meant to say i just i just set up a little slowly that time good sir uh so if you could just uh chill for a little bit i would love that much appreciated buddy you know there's there's a lot of stuff that could be done here lordy lou as they say in france this is a this is a classic mexican standoff except i'm i'm dead i'm so i'm okay so uh don't you know that in here it is guys yes the only time it ever worked my god i'm the greatest player okay i'm not allowed to lose now i can't lose i can't lose i can't if i lose i'll be no wait two foot two two for two squad ah wait wait okay hold on i got too excited there okay yes i can't believe that happened i cannot believe i actually cannot believe that happened that's crazy god okay uh we're just gonna have a t-spin so that we can keep playing okay uh no shoot wait wait wait you can't get rid of me that easily yeah okay come on no no no i placed it horizontally ten years he's wearing a t-spin setup he's running a t-spin set up okay all right we're gonna have to beat him with a four wide this strategy only works when i'm in the greatest situations it never works in any other all right uh it's not gonna work god why am i trying new things against like players that are actually like really good uh i don't know i don't know god i'm panicking okay let's just put this in here call it a day you know it god okay wait hold on hold on man hold on man uh this goes here and then and then and then this goes like this and then you don't hit me don't hit me don't please don't hit me we can be friends hey hey buddy uh i i i did i tell you that your shirt looks just really stellar today it looks beautiful please don't hit me gosh you you have such beautiful eyes what's your name again god they're gonna punish me because i didn't know their name no i threw a little bit but money no okay hold on hold on he's kind of on the ropes here so i feel like if i play my cards he won't be able to see play my cards wrong and because he can't see my incorrect heart there's no feasible way he wins because he doesn't know what i'm doing wrong and that's my logic here uh it is not flawed because i don't even know what i said and that's part of the chart that's the charm of things god the charm he cleared his saucy i should have been faster this whole time but now it's all the ropes are on and honestly i can't live dang it okay all right match point guys i know it's the last game but we can we can win this match point we can win this match point i've never seen us okay why did you do that at the very start of the game man okay i was watching a tetris tutorial video all right so i know that there's a secret maneuver you can do here alright so when you're on the ropes like me and you need huge assistance it is the 100 rule to try and build goodly and that is the secret you just have to build well and as you know i am the best builder since 1904 i used to be a builder back in my back in my youth and my god it worked it worked okay all right yes okay nice nice okay all right great great great great great great that's that's that's that's beautiful that's like that's so pretty that is my gosh did you see how beautiful that was wow there's so much beauty in the eye of the beholder there geez there's like a t spin here god so pretty so now if we all just pay attention to the powerpoint presentation here that's another t spin and yeah so that's the that's part of the powerpoint uh here's another t-spin what the i'm just on it i'm literally on it right now what is this how am i setting up so many teeth i'm okay i'm gonna be honest guys all those were on accident and so i don't really know how it's happening you don't know how it's happening who knows how's it happened who who knows how's it how it how here's another teaspoon and then there's a there's a cool spin and then here's a not cool spin but into a into a there's another t-spin set up okay well here you go buddy and then we just kind of like let it uh let it do its thing and then we just kind of go for it and then the pieces just kind of fall into play and i'm just here's another t-spin my god who am i who am i right now i'm just i'm okay i mean i guess it's it's just all p-spins you know sometimes you just activate t-spin mode and then it's just uh it just happens okay pretty sure i can kill him here if i just kind of play my cards a little bit correctly okay okay if i just play my cards a little bit correctly proceeds to put the piece in china in literal china god yes yeah yes nice okay that worked out well for me that's not working out as well uh okay uh so we're gonna do this uh can we hang a block god we can't hang up all right hold on okay so it was going really well with the t-spin setups before and now it's going what they call really poorly and poorly is actually the opposite of well uh i don't know if you guys knew that but it's true and now it's going really well again and that's what really counts because this guy you know they don't know how bad i am and so they probably think i'm really good but in reality i'm just kind of winging everything and it's just working and i'm like okay that's cool and my god okay all right guys lmfao tiebreaker here we go here we go all right let's make it count we're gonna start with one of these monies and you know this has never failed me except for all the times it's family yes it's gonna film me okay come on come on come on come on come on we can do this we can do this we can do this hold on hold on i'm taking this i'm taking this really seriously now buddy i'm taking this really seriously because i have a chance at victory and it's gonna look so good in the video if i if i come back from this so no mercy okay that's gonna go there that's gonna go there and then i can be able to t spin here into this thing into into just the comeback the king are you serious let's go let's go that's a dub yes yes good game good game lmfo who am i where am i a minus is this a minus this is a minus is this a minus play more games to receive a rank my god all right well i all right guys we're gonna play some more games i thought i was gonna get my rank but uh and i guess it's not a rank reveal until we play more games is it because i only won six is that why all right well i'll see you when we get there i remember what i was gonna say it was we have a game all right well i guess you guys will never know my god why am i against an a plus tier he's literally 5k better than me do you see this do you see this matchmaking guy god no lord he's he's the salty warrior i've heard about this person in legends only i my my gosh my gosh this is crazy this is madness okay fine fine wait what am i doing my brain broke my brain broke god hold on okay all clear we gave him an all clear there he's probably hurt i spit yeah okay guys if you haven't already subscribe for that i spin are you serious uh that was crazy all right and if you know that's just that's just that's just the start of it you know the next thing you know i'll be doing i'll be doing q spins and there's not even a q block in this game god speaking of q spins let me focus a little bit so we don't get q spinned out of existence [Music] okay okay dai focus dai focus time focus absolute no no all right all right that was that was uh i don't want to talk about it i think i can no i'm just going to try to beat him with speed you know i was watching this tetris tutorial and they say always use your eye blocks for attack and i was thinking about it i was like okay that kind of makes sense though right because it's like you know if you waste it on if you waste it on not attack then you you just don't get as much bang for your buck and that's just like man no buck no bang right and you just okay yeah it was gonna be coherent until i started panicking and then it would and then it became even more coherent right guys you know exactly what i was going for shoot my mumble bumble elephants are green tea spin here beautiful uh this is a setup into another t-spin if i can make it to the next t p spin again it's money salty warrior it's a tie baby that's what i call a double t spin into the middle of the game there's no way you expect that there's no way you just can't you can't prepare for that that's like unpreparable ill-prepared yeah but they were like save your save your guys for when you need to when you need to attack and i was like okay i'll i'll try to do that but you know no promises and yeah so we're going to try to implement that kind of and maybe that'll work for us god i didn't mean to do it like this the stars have on a line it's not looking good for me but it's looking great for me all of a sudden how did this ch it's looking terrible it's looking terrible what the he is like an elephant without toes what the he's an elephant without toes how you expect me to beat an elephant without toast how do you expect me to do that there's no way there's no feasible way have you ever been an elephant without toast no so is it possible that i can be an elephant about those maybe but no i put the guy on top of the other guy man all right one two one to two we make it we make it dude we make it do we make it do the one to two okay so this time okay wait guys i don't i don't want to lose so you're about to see me go hyper focused you ready here we go three two one hyper focus mold [Music] i i don't like the things that i stand for i said hyper focus mode and then proceeded to throw completely god yeah ouch that that hurt a little bit good game yes uh yes i'm just gonna let's just let's just queue again guys let's let's just yeah okay all right thank god okay it's it's right here okay good good no if you're here while you're unranked this means that you're a god no he foo me gosh this is no okay all right we can we can do something here it looks like a t-spin setup i'm gonna be honest i mean i got perfect clear setup i mean i could do a t-spin setup it's just not worth it to me because i'm really slow and and that's the problem i'm not i'm not a good t-spin set-up i'm just gonna do this you did it so badly man ah who are you who am i who are who are i hm something seems wrong so okay i was going for a two wide this whole time actually guys this is my new technique it's called the 2y back in the 1940s this technique was used by many professional players to sort of flex on the other goons this technique was used mainly in uh this southern uh hemisphere as a technique to uh defeat the mongolians from uh attacking them by guy okay cool that was a good game you know i i'm just gonna guess that goes there honestly uh i uh yeah cool it works so speaking of the mongolians here gosh if i was if i was just a little bit smarter maybe i would have won that okay well you're doing that thing it's called attacking and i don't really appreciate that so i'm gonna just like do this you know what i mean and then i'll do that you know i feel like i should t spin more i feel like t spinning just gives you like the t to t winning you know you just t spin and then like the other people are just like gosh how do we deal with it and then you're just like i don't know i'm not the one getting t spin on so you know good luck man and then they're just like god my god my god what my i just my god how many lines is that a million two million maybe three million it's probably three million honestly if i were to if i were to take a guess there that was probably three million that's that's probably three million and i mean okay guys if you wouldn't subscribe for three million three million lines have you ever seen that in tetris probably not and let me tell you i just did it so you know you know hit that hit that subscribe button if you haven't already you know it's it's it's it's part of the it's part of all right all

you're watching now you know you should just subscribe out of pity for me look how sad this is i've dropped 500 ranking i had a way better piece per second than him my attacks per minute weren't even that much lower you know it's just like i feel so bad for dai gaming i'll have to subscribe god i have a 50 win rate now okay all right that's that's all i have for today i i uh yeah that was that

we will be playing some more tetra.io that is right we're going to first do our quick warm-up but don't worry i'll just speed through this so we can get right down and dirty to these ranked games coming up but yeah we've got the battle music selected and here we go just gonna try and i don't know be swift uh but it seems like i'm really struggling a little bit here nice we opened it it's money we got this bam bam bam bam i just shoved that there that's fine that's fine though okay god okay uh yes my my commentary right commentary is good yes i speak well i know what to say here okay just the faster the you go the less commentary you need to stay that's maybe that should be my motivation because i'm so bad at talking while playing tetris that i should just be so fast that i just don't need to say anything and then you guys can just see the game and then that'll be it it'll be great god okay money okay nice nice okay now we're now we're getting into it okay yes boom 117 okay yes all right now we're ready to go i think that's good enough i have only been grinding since the last video so we're gonna get into this multiplayer tetra league and it's gonna be crazy alright let's go getting ready for the next battle all right we're against pal two they're also unrated so uh man this might be uh this might be a little risque you know maybe they're like really good okay looking at the setup we're gonna go for a four wide this is crazy all right we're gonna go for a four wide no one has ever seen die gaming do this before we already screwed it we already screwed up i uh this is why die gaming never does god god okay hold on no no wait hold on hold on hey hey we can talk about this i'm just trying to get like a four wide setup going you know so uh if you could just not attack me that would be really split okay here i'm just gonna attack him because i'm kind of scared three four five uh count my count my knees no i messed it up i messed it up okay this is fine this is mine i mean this is this is fine this is still money we we sent him a lot of lines probably i mean if i was really good at the game i'd peek over at a screen right now but then i'd have to stop playing should i do it yeah he's like almost dead go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go he's he's almost dead he's almost dead it's almost it's pretty much okay it's pretty much guaranteed here watch watch watch boom baby boom boom bada bing bada bam look how fast i'm going look at the speed look at this absolute speed my god it's like i didn't even read whoa let's not get too cocky here against pal 2 though how to second round all right this is looking like a t god wait no it's not lord jesus okay yeah just slide this in there okay great okay now we now we just have to think now we just have to use our brains uh okay our brains did not function there okay this is good this is fine this is fine look at this t-spin them yeah yeah nice okay and now we do like this like this like this bam bam bam and yeah we're just okay we're okay we're actually like pretty quick here i'd be surprised if he can actually like i don't know when when out here this is like this is some crazy speed that we're that we're hitting you know we're hitting we're hitting next-gen speed right now god it worked out it worked out i mean i meant to do that that's of course yeah okay great i think he's dead see ya that's a win i don't need a move yes nice match point guys match point we're doing really well today we're just completely creaming them what is this okay we're gonna try again with a perfect clear here and the secret technique of the perfect clear is that you just have to use your brain because then you get a perfect clear and then everyone's like shoot he got a perfect clear like he used his brain and then watch this watch just watch this uh no i don't think i could have gotten an another one though man gg pal well i'll type gg to you even though you're gone yeah that was pretty good guys man starting off strong this time i mean hey i'll take it another one is it against pal pal3 no what does this mean seven five eight nine tr is this like really good i don't know ling lyj okay that's kinda okay i mean we can we can we can it's fine yeah it's it's fine it's fine he's not like going to be like insane right it's just 7 000 something hopefully i don't really know i i haven't really thought about the rankings at all in this game so i'm just kind of he's going real slow either he's going really slow or lagging i think it was the lagging one okay i mean that's cool that's all it's all good we were able to uh counter him pretty much completely there which is sick uh okay i'll just send it right back buddy and then we can uh look at how clean that board was for a second there okay we'll do this this this this my god do you see me right now i'm going crazy i'm just popping off what is this my gosh i'm just doing really well today i jeez i uh i mean hey i'm not complaining i'm just i guess i'm just on it what could have been right it's okay jeez geez okay all right okay okay okay we got this guys we can do this we can do this no god lord okay this is still money money money it's all money it's all money until you until it's not money okay wait hold on hold on hold on use your brain use your brain there it is that's what we were looking for boom t-spin into that into this my god you just got damaged you're you're just like done yes my gosh the stars aligned for that one my why am i on fire today this is i i'm going i'm popping i'm popping like no it's okay slightly edited t-spin setup okay boom uh no it's not happening wait did this person give up no i think they're lagging again no they gave up wing man gg ling that's uh that's unfortunate i think they they either gave up or lagged out there so hello g god i didn't mean to set chi chi three times man okay well nice i mean hey uh i guess we just keep going all right sweet i'll see you guys when we get one here's another one all right all right we're against 8 30 tr now against jeff 3333 hopefully three games is all we play and hopefully all of those are my wins but i don't know i don't know it's been pretty good today so you too there we go wow what a nice person let's see if i do it like this then it's money sorry perfect clear baby it's not you it's me no it's me it's me i it's definitely me god all right hold on hold on hold on we can we can still come back from this yes okay yes yes we definitely can come back from this man now we're gonna press the advantage here we have to press the it yes let's go man i'm like i'm just doing it today i'm just completely just pressing my advantage like i'm going crazy no this way watch this and then we go like this and then we ah so close okay that's fine that's fine geez jeez he's sending like a lot of singles here no uh no no no no it's back to it's back to throwing mode it's back to die throwing die throwing uh it's okay it's okay one one by one we'll just okay there we go die throwing uh there we go okay no no die throwing is that just that's like that's my new alter ego it's die throwing no no wait hold on it's tight throwing it's not throwing okay no no shoot i double tapped man man okay guys uh uh okay so we see the yellow coming up so we're gonna be able to do it like this okay great it's still good guys we're still money cash cash indeed let's go my god yo what my my gosh my fingers are flying what is this okay uh okay great then this this this this uh this one i think i've made a grave error in my judgment and it rhymes with error what yeah god okay uh there's there's this here and then there's this here and this here sorry pal uh this is what i call the ancient technique uh it's called uh i'm throwing and it's really good it's actually so good it's called i've reawakened and i'm on the offensive now buddy yo uh uh this should just i'll just i i don't know why i'm thinking so much when i could just be playing the game you're really high up there man it's uh it might not look good for you here i'm gonna have to send you a couple lines and it might be over for you see uh right after i get sorry jeff dang gg wow i i've just been getting three o's he's so nice or she gg well played man bye jeff i feel bad i'm just man today like people up against me are they're stumbling i'm uh i've really got it instant match found is it against pal5 a b plus here last time i went up against a b-plus tier i got destroyed so this time we're gonna try we're gonna try and get this against joe han here okay this is this is no joke this is a b plus we lost to the b pluses last time so this time we're just gonna have to give them our main technique of perfect clearing them at the very start and

know that you're enjoying this tetris grind as much as i am but other than that i guess i'll see you guys in the next video peace that's it i'm entering maximspeed focus mode what's up guys dai gaming here and today we will be playing my favorite game ever tetra dot io yes this is unlike normal tetris because we've got multiplayer mode we've got solo mode and we've got config all right no no no all right we got solo mode first i'm gonna do a quick 40 line warm-up we've already got the random battle music on we're gonna warm up because today we will be playing the tetra league that's right it's basically the pokemon league actually i don't know that at all that's just me making something up but yeah i know i've been really hyped but i just haven't had the chance to play the tetra league yet so i'm super excited today to be able to play that with you guys but yeah so i've uh i've been putting this off because i actually suck at talking while playing this game so i've been trying to practice speaking while playing and not making any mistakes but it's not really working yeah so anyway uh focus on this focus yes there's lots of focus going on sometimes you know you just can't think of anything to say while playing tetris you know sometimes you just have to let the game speak for itself and uh yeah well those are the wise words of die it sounds profound in my head but then i say it and it sounds so dumb god okay yes this is fine this is fine right so uh i yes this goes here and this goes here and then we can just put this here boom boom but a bing but a boom yes we're looking good now we're looking really good okay all right we're almost done we're almost there done nice okay so 122 that's not a that's not a great time but for me chatting while playing that's a great time all right 122. all right now we're ready for the actual tetra league that's right we did a quick warm-up there the tetra league is a competitive 1v1 mode when duels against players of similar skill to rank up and conquer the leaderboards if you're new to stackers or feeling rusty it's a good idea to practice in other modes first well i might be feeling rusty but we're gonna find our first ever match that's right see 0 out of 10 rating games played so i will see you guys when we finally get a match because it seems like there's only 10 people in queue so i don't know if any of them will be my skill level all right guys i'm gonna go get some water i i doubt there's going to be a wow uh all right let's get going guys god it's us versus super lopo he's he's a b-plus tier i don't know what we're gonna i don't know if we're gonna be able to take him down okay all right here we go yes the applause the applause very well okay so there's no way he'll be able to stop us okay come on we can we can destroy him come on we got this guys don't let him stop us come on guys we got this nice nice we've already sent him lines no i've made a mistake i've made a grave error god guys okay it's okay it's okay it's okay focus focus we can do this we can do this god my my my nerves are nervous my palms are nervous these weak arms are nervous there's vomit on his nervous already god okay okay all right hold on all right everyone focus focus we can do this we can do this okay uh it's all money it's all money it's all money it's okay it's okay okay put this here put this here all right uh yes and then this can go here boom but a bing but a bam let's go all right yes we're not gonna let him beat us so easily okay so all right here it is my secret technique uh activate open the block god i didn't mean that it slid in beautifully it slid in like like what's that one cinderella and and the seven dwarves no i'm building really high i'm laughing okay okay hold on guys hold on we gotta focus to make sure that we stay alive here because we can't lose to this person we cannot lose guys we can't lose here we can't let them have this we can't let them have this victory on us god the screen's turning red ah i can barely see no i can't lose no okay okay hold on hold on we can do this guys we can still do this we can still do this i know it looks grim i know it looks grim i know it looks bad but we've been out of tougher situations i've fought the kings of this game there's no way you can beat me no uh wait hold on we can do this we can still do this it's still it's no god super lopo beat us the first time it's okay it's okay we had a lot of missed plays that time i still think we can do it okay ready activate secret technique no no the secret technique is not gonna work this time it's okay spin the technique okay okay all right so we got the spin in we still need to really focus here to make sure that we don't lose just right off the bat all right slide those in okay great we can't let this guy beat us so easily ah no i keep i keep throwing this place god lord lordy lou come on we gotta we gotta gotta believe guys we gotta believe that's the problem we're not believing hard enough right now but all we need is a little bit of energy here we go nice okay okay we can turn it around we can turn it around we can definitely turn it yes yes yes all right nice he's on the ropes now so all we have to do is not make any misplays here i feel like i just cursed myself but we don't need to make any misplaced here and then we might be able to push him over the top by making him lose through tetris god okay we can do this check this out wait wait wait no i had it i had it no no no no it was so close i had it i felt it i could feel it slide in and but it didn't it didn't do it it didn't do it it like i threw it i threw it what do i do what do i do what do i do let's just panic let's just panic let's just send it as many lines as possible it's fine it's fine it's fine it's fine it's fine it's fine it's fine it's just uh uh you know honestly guys god i i'm panicking i'm i'm just there's just a lot of there's a lot of there's just okay it's okay it's okay snap okay god we're just letting him have us we can't let him take have his way with us also i'm glad this is like a best of three system or else it would be over already and we would have already wait okay hold on okay guys okay guys we can't just lose it here our story can't end here we need to win we need to be able to no no he's cleared lines how is this possible we must stop him with a t spin yes maximpotential t spin there there's no way there's no way you can beat me when i have all my potential lying outside the window with another t spin yes get wrecked by my t spin the setup god god okay wait hold on the t-spin setup won't work god god god no no we can't lie we can't die here we're blinking we're blinking guys we're blinking no no no no he's got us it's two to zero god it's not best of three okay we can do this then all right we can't let him beat us again come on i know i know that he's good but it doesn't mean he's great and that means that we can beat him if we just put our minds to it if we just if we just completely try our best here he can't stop us he's feeling cocky he's feeling confident but now is the time we strike back after all we are die gaming and we can't be lord what was that okay okay we can't let him just we can't let him just easy peasy us like this that is that is that is that is the term that is the tetris term for him destroying us here we can't let him easy peasy us so we have to bring it back okay okay we see that the tea is coming up so we we want to give him a little bit of sauce here so we're gonna rotate that in and so now he's gonna be a little bit more worried and then we can just try and play our best okay all right okay i know the board is not looking good right now but i know the board doesn't look great but the board is ours and ours only so even if the board doesn't look great we know that at least it's our board and and our board is the best board okay okay we got this we got this we can bring it back we can bring it back okay okay don't worry guys okay this is fine so we're gonna rotate these pieces like this we can't let him recover he's already recovering and that's the problem that's the greatest problem that's our problem right now we're just letting this guy have his way with us because we're letting him recover too easily no no we need time to recover as well though hold on hold on we can do this we can do this okay that's it i'm entering maximspeed focus mode ah you can't stop me with that i'm in my maximspeed focus mode ah there's no way you can stop me i'm the protagonist of the story and this is the comeback of the century come on we can do it we just need a little more energy you're the villain and i have to stop you here or else the story can't go further okay no we made a mistake we've made an error in our judgment but that's okay because we've trained we've been fighting with the with the legends we've been fighting with the legends themselves so there's no way you can beat us because we've been fighting at this top speed since we've started ha nice t spin there to recover no he's attacking that's okay we can do this guys my hands are getting tired i've never been in a duel this intense no no a miss play is that our fatal error or we'll be able to or will we be able to turn it around here no okay all right we got this no don't cover that shoot no we need it no no no no no no we're throwing no no how can this be no no there's no way no no we threw at the last second we had it ah a defeat how did this happen look at the apm his apm was higher but our pieces per second were better let's tell them good game game super it was close guys it was really close are we gonna be fighting super lopro again no someone else brunito all right he's only a beat here we can do this guys we can beat a beat here come on b tiers are for getting beaten we can do this here's the league okay come on we're still reeling for my last fight but we're hungry we're hungry for a win and that's what this game's all about winning we can do it listen we've trained against super lopo himself isn't that right who am i talking to i don't know but isn't that right ah you think you can send me lines shoot you really can you're actually better than i you're better i mean sorry you're better than i thought [Music] well looks like i'm on the ropes now that's not a good thing that's actually not a good thing no okay we had to do that we had to do that because we were on the ropes and we needed to we needed to do that so that we had to block it we just had to there was no other way i looked at all the chances that we had and that was the only way no how are we losing here we can't just lose here he's not a b plus he's an s tier [Music] no bonito okay all right we're gonna have to use our secret technique secret technique maximpotential perfect we don't have it we didn't get the lineup okay it's fine no no how's he going so fast he's ascended this guy this guy is in our normal our normal tetris player huh we're gonna have to spin it back to him he's not a normal tetris player he's more than that he's a tetris demon no not a tetris demon no okay we can't let him we can't let him just win it here we need to open the line the line has been opened and now we're sending it back come on we can get this win all we need to do is focus just focus a little bit just a tiny bit we can do it [Music] ah no we need to send it back immediately okay come on yes that's our first win guys okay we're tying it up [Music] we can do it we can do it all right activate secret technique perfect clear setup okay send this in no yes perfect clear lucria yes that sent him a ton of lines to start with now we have a little bit of time to work with even though we messed up the rest of our setups god lord okay all right hold on hold on hold on no no he's sending it all back now no no we were supposed to kill him there no no okay it's fine guys we can still turn it around okay it's okay just focus just focus hold on hold on we have to show him who's boss no he's opening the lines back this is bad this is really really bad no ah we didn't kill him fast enough with the perfect clear now he gets another point okay we're gonna try to risk it again a perfect clear setup we need to be able to do this fast enough so that he doesn't attack us okay okay use your brain no it didn't work okay we're just gonna have to build we're gonna have to build quickly and without any regrets or that's not the word without any hesitation that's the word hesitation is the word i was looking for okay no no i made a mistake it's okay okay we're gonna have to hit him what we're gonna do is we're gonna hit him with two moves at once this is going to make it so that he can't even breathe god god i can't breathe no he set it up he set up the t spin strategy no no no it's a defeat no way we were so close look at his pieces per second they were so much lower than ours i can't believe this happened we knew what he was doing yeah we lost okay guys we've we've already taken two losses but that's not going to stop us uno mas here's the final the final game that i'll play and with this one we're gonna win so i'll see you guys when it happens maybe i just have to say that i want to get my water again and then they'll be like all right we got you a match ready watch watch

doing poorly right now the last few games have made me weak i should have taken a break this back-to-back tetris thing has has made me lose my touch i spent myself on that first game trying to win and i couldn't clutch it so now this game i'm weaker than i usually am but my weak self is enough to take you down let's go nice one win for the for die gaming okay we're gonna hit him with what he least expects a perfect clear off the bat perfect clear luckily nice god he sent us lines okay focus and we'll send them all back to him there's no way he'll be able to stop this this is what i call on the slot technique maximpotential [Music] because it's maximpotential because we end up with a spin goodbye that's two for us it's looking good here's the match point let's show him shrew terror full speed mode here we go be swift all right we're gonna focus this time and make sure that we play absolutely perfectly to give him a challenge that he deserves [Music] okay it's looking good he said so many lines at once was he not the noob that i thought he was no i i made a grave error it's okay we're gonna have to bring it back through a series of god through a series of clutch plays i know it

i threw it what do i do what do i do what do i do let's just panic let's just panic let's just send it as many lines as possible it's fine it's fine it's fine it's fine it's fine it's fine it's fine it's just uh uh you know honestly guys oh god i i'm panicking i'm i'm just there's just a lot of there's a lot of there's just okay it's okay it's okay oh oh oh snap okay oh god we're just letting him have us we can't let him take have his way with us also i'm glad this is like a best of three system or else it would be over already and we would have already wait okay hold on okay guys okay guys we can't just lose it here our story can't end here we need to win we need to be able to oh no no he's cleared lines how is this possible we must stop him with a t spin yes maximum potential t spin there there's no way there's no way you can beat me when i have all my potential lying outside the window with another t spin yes get wrecked by my t spin the setup oh god oh god okay wait hold on the t-spin setup won't work oh god oh god oh god no no we can't lie we can't die here we're blinking we're blinking guys we're blinking no no no no he's got us it's two to zero oh god oh it's not best of three okay we can do this then all right we can't let him beat us again come on i know i know that he's good but it doesn't mean he's great and that means that we can beat him if we just put our minds to it if we just if we just completely try our best here he can't stop us he's feeling cocky he's feeling confident but now is the time we strike back after all we are die gaming and we can't be oh oh lord what was that okay okay we can't let him just we can't let him just easy peasy us like this that is that is that is that is the term that is the tetris term for him destroying us here we can't let him easy peasy us so we have to bring it back okay okay we see that the tea is coming up so we we want to give him a little bit of sauce here so we're gonna rotate that in and so now he's gonna be a little bit more worried and then we can just try and play our best okay all right um okay i know the board is not looking good right now but i know the board doesn't look great but the board is ours and ours only so even if the board doesn't look great we know that at least it's our board and and our board is the best board okay okay we got this we got this we can bring it back we can bring it back okay okay don't worry guys okay this is fine um so we're gonna rotate these pieces like this we can't let him recover he's already recovering and that's the problem that's the greatest problem that's our problem right now we're just letting this guy have his way with us because we're letting him recover too easily oh no oh no we need time to recover as well though um hold on hold on we can do this we can do this okay that's it i'm entering maximum speed focus mode ah you can't stop me with that i'm in my maximum speed focus mode ah there's no way you can stop me i'm the protagonist of the story and this is the comeback of the century come on we can do it we just need a little more energy you're the villain and i have to stop you here or else the story can't go further okay no we made a mistake we've made an error in our judgment but that's okay because we've trained we've been fighting with the with the legends we've been fighting with the legends themselves so there's no way you can beat us because we've been fighting at this top speed since we've started ha nice t spin there to recover oh no he's attacking that's okay we can do this guys my hands are getting tired i've never been in a duel this intense oh no oh no a miss play is that our fatal error or we'll be able to or will we be able to turn it around here oh no okay all right we got this no don't cover that oh shoot no we need it no no no no no no we're throwing no no how can this be no no there's no way no no we threw at the last second we had it ah a defeat how did this happen look at the apm his apm was higher but our pieces per second were better let's tell them good game game super it was close guys it was really close oh are we gonna be fighting super lopro again no someone else brunito all right he's only a beat here we can do this guys we can beat a beat here come on b tiers are for getting beaten we can do this here's the league okay come on we're still reeling for my last fight but we're hungry we're hungry for a win and that's what this game's all about winning we can do it listen we've trained against super lopo himself isn't that right who am i talking to i don't know but isn't that right ah you think you can send me lines oh shoot you really can you're actually better than i you're better i mean sorry you're better than i thought [Music] well looks like i'm on the ropes now that's not a good thing that's actually not a good thing no okay we had to do that we had to do that because we were on the ropes and we needed to we needed to do that so that we had to block it we just had to um there was no other way i looked at all the chances that we had and that was the only way oh no how are we losing here we can't just lose here he's not a b plus he's an s tier [Music] no bonito okay all right we're gonna have to use our secret technique secret technique maximum potential perfect we don't have it we didn't get the lineup okay it's fine oh no oh no how's he going so fast he's ascended this guy this guy is in our normal our normal tetris player huh we're gonna have to spin it back to him he's not a normal tetris player he's more than that he's a tetris demon no not a tetris demon oh no okay we can't let him we can't let him just win it here we need to open the line the line has been opened and now we're sending it back come on we can get this win all we need to do is focus just focus a little bit just a tiny bit we can do it [Music] ah no we need to send it back immediately okay come on yes that's our first win guys okay we're tying it up [Music] we can do it we can do it all right activate secret technique perfect clear setup okay send this in no yes perfect clear oh lucria yes that sent him a ton of lines to start with now we have a little bit of time to work with even though we messed up the rest of our setups oh god oh lord okay all right hold on hold on hold on oh no oh no he's sending it all back now oh no oh no we were supposed to kill him there oh no oh no okay it's fine guys we can still turn it around okay it's okay just focus just focus hold on hold on we have to show him who's boss no he's opening the lines back this is bad this is really really bad no ah we didn't kill him fast enough with the perfect clear now he gets another point okay we're gonna try to risk it again a perfect clear setup we need to be able to do this fast enough so that he doesn't attack us okay um okay use your brain no it didn't work okay we're just gonna have to build we're gonna have to build quickly and without any regrets or that's not the word without any hesitation that's the word hesitation is the word i was looking for okay no no i made a mistake it's okay okay we're gonna have to hit him what we're gonna do is we're gonna hit him with two moves at once this is going to make it so that he can't even breathe oh god oh god i can't breathe oh no he set it up he set up the t spin strategy no no no it's a defeat no way we were so close look at his pieces per second they were so much lower than ours i can't believe this happened we knew what he was doing yeah we lost okay guys we've we've already taken two losses but that's not going to stop us uno mas here's the final the final game that i'll play and with this one we're gonna win so i'll see you guys when it happens maybe i just have to say that i want to get my water

we're not b minus we're a no well you know we're not actually a uh okay come on let's just oh no oh oh god i'm i'm really doing poorly right now the last few games have made me weak i should have taken a break this back-to-back tetris thing has has made me lose my touch i spent myself on that first game trying to win and i couldn't clutch it so now this game i'm weaker than i usually am but my weak self is enough to take you down let's go nice one win for the for die gaming okay we're gonna hit him with what he least expects a perfect clear off the bat perfect clear oh luckily nice oh god he sent us lines okay focus and we'll send them all back to him there's no way he'll be able to stop this this is what i call on the slot technique maximum potential [Music] because it's maximum potential because we end up with a spin goodbye that's two for us it's looking good here's the match point let's show him shrew terror full speed mode here we go be swift all right we're gonna focus this time and make sure that we play absolutely perfectly to give him a challenge that he deserves [Music] okay it's looking good he said so many lines at once was he not the noob that i thought he was no i i made a grave error it's okay we're gonna have to bring it back through a series of oh god through a series of clutch plays i know it might not look good for me right now but with the power of friendship anything is possible like turning it around yes it worked let's go oh good game oh we left the room yes yes i forgot to say good game to the last guy but yes we did it listen to that
